                                <strong>LoLCBL</strong> seeks to supply a solution to a problem which has been plaguing the League of Legends community for years. A similar system known as <i>"The Tribunal"</i> was put in place by Riot Games for a short period of time, however it proved unsuccessful at making a difference and was barely used outside of players making misuse of the system in order to collect its rewards. For years, a large vocal minority of the League of Legends community, and popular personalities, have been pleading its developers to release and make use of a similar system with small adjustments but to no avail. LoLCBL was inspired from a similar project titled "<a href="https://thecbl.net/"><u>TheCBL</u></a>" which was terminated in 2015; a volunteer-driven Community Ban List for the game <i>Combat Arms</i> published by Nexon. It was widely used and respected within the Combat Arms community for various purposes such as clan recruitment and even came to be publicly recognized by Nexon America. TheCBL was instrumental in the suspension of tens of thousands of cheaters, and was an efficient deterrent against anyone who would consider making use of cheats, bug exploits and other kinds of unfair advantages within the game. LoLCBL aims to do the same, however its extent would cover more behaviours, especially griefing.

                                LoLCBL pulls information from Riot Games' various APIs to show Summoner information. When players are reported and flagged, their PUUID is stored in a database which we check with every search in order to display one's CBL Status. Reports are sent in by users, verified by CBL Staff, and ultimately approved or denied according to our guidelines. Once a report has been approved, all information pertaining to that report will be publicly displayed on their CBL profile.

If you are unable to prove ownership of the account, the appeal will be rejected regardless of any other information provided. If CBL Staff finds that your profile was incorrectly flagged, your status will be cleared. Do keep in mind that flagging reversal is incredibly rare, as flagging should only be done when the player has been found guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Also note that CBL Staff will never accept payment to clear CBL Statuses.

In the case of LoLCBL however, users are able to submit reports for players who they believe are infringing upon the Summoner's Code - LoLCBL Staff would then reject or approve them according to a thorough, trusted and transparent process. If a player is found to be guilty their profile would then on be permanently flagged and all offenses, with provided evidence, publicly listed on their profile. To better understand our guidelines, please visit our <a href="faq.html"><u>Guidelines &amp; FAQ section</u></a>.</p>
<!-- Once a Summoner profile is flagged users are then able to forward a pre-formatted report to Riot Games. CBL Statuses are tied to an account's PUUID, it cannot be dodged with a name change. If you believe a judgement to be incorrect, options to appeal will be available on flagged profiles. -->
